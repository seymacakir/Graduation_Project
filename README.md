# Personalized Dynamic Pricing in Agricultural Loan Applications

The project aims to optimize interest rates for agricultural loan applicants by using machine learning models to estimate price sensitivity and apply dynamic pricing strategies.

## Key Features & Methodology

*Data Preparation:* Cleaning, handling missing values, feature selection. (data is not available because of confidentiality concerns.)
*Machine Learning Models:*
-Logistic Regression (baseline model).
-Clustering-based segmentation (unsupervised & semi-supervised).
-Model-Based Tree for adaptive segmentation.
*Pricing Strategies:*
-Dynamic Pricing with Milestones (adjusts pricing based on targets).
-Aggressive Pricing (higher price, lower acceptance).
-Defensive Pricing (lower price, higher acceptance).
-Controlled Variance Pricing (randomized within historical ranges).
*Evaluation & Simulation:* Performance analysis through simulations.
